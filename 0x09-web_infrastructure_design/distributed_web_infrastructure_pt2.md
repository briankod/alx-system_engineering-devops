# Web infrastructure design

## 1. Distributed web infrastructure

### Issues with this infrastructure

- **SPOF (Single Point Of Failure).**
    Failure of the server causes whole network to collapse

- **Security issues.**
    Prone to malware and interception by third parties to gather data passed between the two systems (no firewall, no HTTPS).
- **No monitoring.**
    You cannot assess the health and performance of your servers in real-time.
